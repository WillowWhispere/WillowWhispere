Introduction
------------

Shadowsocks-Qt5 is a native and cross-platform GUI client for [Shadowsocks](http://shadowsocks.org).

Features
--------

- Shadowsocks-Qt5 is written in C++/Qt5.
- Intuitive and **native** UI. This is **not** a clumsy Web App.
- Easy-to-use and highly customisable.
- `config.ini` is located under `~/.config/shadowsocks-qt5/` on \*nix platforms, or under the application's directory on Windows.

Note
----

- If `ss-qt5` crashes and the single-instance mode is on, you may need to manually delete `/tmp/qipc_sharedmemory_shadowsocksqt*` and `/tmp/qipc_systemsem_shadowsocksqt*`. Otherwise, `ss-qt5` will complain that another instance is already running.
- Don't be panic if you encounter a bug. Please feel free to open [issues](https://github.com/librehat/shadowsocks-qt5/issues). Just remember to run from terminal or `cmd` and paste the output to the description of issue.
